# Memory Leak Fixes for Hybrid Liquid-Spiking Neural Networks

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive memory leak fixes implemented in the hybrid liquid-spiking neural network codebase. These fixes address critical memory management issues that can lead to GPU memory exhaustion during training and inference.

## Memory Leak Sources Identified and Fixed

### 1. SpikingEncoder Memory Leaks
**Problem**: List accumulation of spike recordings causing exponential memory growth
**Location**: `src/core/main.py` - SpikingEncoder.forward()
**Fix**: 
- Replaced `spk_recordings = []` list accumulation with pre-allocated tensors
- Used `safe_zeros()` for memory-managed tensor creation
- Pre-compute tensor shapes to avoid repeated allocations

**Before**:
```python
spk_recordings = []
for step in range(self.num_steps):
    # ... spike computation ...
    spk_recordings.append(spk2)
return torch.stack(spk_recordings, dim=1)
```

**After**:
```python
spike_output = safe_zeros((batch_size, self.num_steps, output_dim), 
                         device=x.device, dtype=x.dtype)
for step in range(self.num_steps):
    # ... spike computation ...
    spike_output[:, step, :] = spk2
return spike_output
```

### 2. HybridLiquidSpikingBlock Memory Leaks
**Problem**: List accumulation during sequence processing for LLM tasks
**Location**: `src/core/main.py` - HybridLiquidSpikingBlock.forward()
**Fix**:
- Replaced `outputs = []` list with pre-allocated tensor
- Used `safe_zeros()` for memory-managed allocation
- Direct tensor indexing instead of list append + concatenation

**Before**:
```python
outputs = []
for t in range(seq_len):
    # ... processing ...
    outputs.append(output.unsqueeze(1))
final_output = torch.cat(outputs, dim=1)
```

**After**:
```python
output_tensor = safe_zeros((batch_size, seq_len, self.output_dim), 
                          device=x.device, dtype=x.dtype)
for t in range(seq_len):
    # ... processing ...
    output_tensor[:, t, :] = output.squeeze(1) if output.dim() > 2 else output
```

### 3. MultiHeadSpikingAttention Memory Leaks
**Problem**: Triple list accumulation for query, key, value spikes
**Location**: `src/core/main.py` - MultiHeadSpikingAttention.forward()
**Fix**:
- Replaced three separate spike lists with pre-allocated accumulators
- Used `safe_zeros()` for memory-managed tensor creation
- Optimized tensor reshaping to minimize memory copies

**Before**:
```python
q_spikes = []
k_spikes = []
v_spikes = []
for _ in range(self.spike_steps):
    # ... spike computation ...
    q_spikes.append(q_spk.view(...))
    k_spikes.append(k_spk.view(...))
    v_spikes.append(v_spk.view(...))
```

**After**:
```python
q_spike_accumulator = safe_zeros((self.spike_steps, batch_size, self.num_heads, seq_len, self.head_dim), 
                                device=x.device, dtype=x.dtype)
# Similar for k and v accumulators
for step in range(self.spike_steps):
    # ... spike computation ...
    q_spike_accumulator[step] = q_spk.view(...)
```

### 4. Training Loop Memory Leaks
**Problem**: Accumulation of intermediate tensors without cleanup
**Location**: `src/core/main.py` - LiquidSpikingTrainer.train_epoch()
**Fix**:
- Added periodic memory cleanup every 50 batches
- Explicit tensor deletion before cleanup
- Integrated memory manager for automated cleanup

**Implementation**:
```python
memory_cleanup_interval = 50
if batch_idx % memory_cleanup_interval == 0 and batch_idx > 0:
    self.memory_manager.cleanup_memory()
    del data, targets, outputs, loss
```

### 5. EMA Model Memory Leaks
**Problem**: Non-in-place operations creating memory accumulation
**Location**: `src/core/main.py` - LiquidSpikingTrainer._update_ema()
**Fix**:
- Used in-place operations to prevent memory accumulation
- Added gradient tracking prevention with `torch.no_grad()`
- Added safety checks for EMA model existence

**Before**:
```python
self.ema_model[name] = (self.ema_decay * self.ema_model[name] + 
                       (1 - self.ema_decay) * param.data)
```

**After**:
```python
with torch.no_grad():
    self.ema_model[name].mul_(self.ema_decay).add_(
        param.data, alpha=(1 - self.ema_decay)
    )
```
